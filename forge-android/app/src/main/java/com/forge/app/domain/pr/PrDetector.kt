/**
 * Personal-record detection. A set counts as a PR when its `weight_lb` is strictly
 * greater than every previously logged set for the same exercise that was performed
 * at the same-or-higher rep count.
 *
 * Rationale: "more weight at this rep range" is the standard strength-training
 * definition of a PR. Comparing only against same-or-higher rep sets keeps low-rep
 * heavy work from being trivially "beaten" by high-rep light work (and vice versa).
 *
 * Sets without a numeric weight (e.g. "BW", parser returned null) never count as PRs
 * — bodyweight progression is tracked by reps, which we don't surface as a PR in 3c.
