/**
 * The plan-mode card illustration: a pre-rendered looping video (alpha-transparent animated WebP,
 * authored in `remotion-vignettes/` and rendered into res/raw) when the platform can play it,
 * else the live Canvas vignette. The Canvas twin also covers reduce-motion (frozen final frame)
 * and the first frames while the WebP decodes off the main thread.
 *
 * The videos don't loop forever: each loops [PLAN_LOOPS] times then FREEZES on its last frame. The
 * compositions are authored so frame 0 and the last frame are the SAME finished plan (a built week ·
 * a hand-built day · a caught freestyle log), so the loop restart is seamless (no jump) AND the freeze
 * lands on that plan instead of endlessly rebuilding. A shared [PlanModeSync] gates the videos so they
 * all start (and therefore loop and freeze) on the same frame.
 *
 * Frozen is not final: tapping a card bumps its `replays` counter and the video plays its two loops
 * again from the top. Only the tapped card replays — see [StepPlanMode].
