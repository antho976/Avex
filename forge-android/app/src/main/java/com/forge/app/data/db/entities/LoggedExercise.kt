/**
 * One exercise slot within a session. `exerciseId` references the static
 * [com.forge.app.program.ExercisePlan.id] (e.g. "ua1", "lb6") — no FK to a
 * Room table because the catalogue lives in code, not the DB.
 *
 * `swappedName` / `swappedUnit` are set when the user uses the swap feature
 * during this specific session — they override the static plan for this entry.
 * They are NOT the same as [ExerciseCustomization] (which is a persistent swap
 * carried across all future sessions for the same `exerciseId`).
 *
 * Cascade delete: deleting the parent Session removes its LoggedExercises and,
 * transitively, their LoggedSets.
