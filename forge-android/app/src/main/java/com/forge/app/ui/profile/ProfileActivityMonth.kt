/**
 * # ACTIVITY — this month, as a calendar of contribution squares
 *
 * The same contribution-grid vocabulary as [ProfileActivityYear] — rounded squares, one fixed ramp,
 * a LESS/MORE key — scoped to the current calendar month and turned ninety degrees.
 *
 * ## Why the month turns and the year does not
 *
 * A contribution graph is weekday-down, week-across because a year is 53 weeks long and only seven
 * days tall: that orientation is what lets a year fit a screen at all. A month is the opposite
 * shape — six weeks by seven days — so borrowing the year's orientation puts six columns on a page
 * with room for twenty-six, which is exactly what the first attempt did and why it read as a small
 * square with nothing beside it.
 *
 * Turned, a month IS a calendar: seven weekday columns, five or six week rows. Same squares, same
 * ramp, same key — the mark is unchanged, only its axes swap to suit the window.
 *
 * ## Edge to edge (2026-08-24)
 *
 * The grid spent 0.75 of the measure for a while, to buy back the height seven full-width columns
 * cost. On device that trade read as a bug, not as restraint: the anchor above it, the readings
 * line below it and the LESS/MORE key all run to the right margin, so a grid stopping a quarter
 * short is the one element on the page that fails to reach it — Antho pointed straight at the gap
 * ("make the activity reach the full side, there's empty space").
 *
 * So it takes the whole measure. The cells are square and sized off the width, which means width is
 * the only size control there is: full width puts a day near 42dp and the section near 295dp, and
 * that height is the honest price of a month drawn as squares rather than a number to be trimmed
 * back. It buys a calendar you can actually read a date off, on the same margins as everything
 * else on the page.
 *
 * ## Compact footer (2026-08-31)
 *
 * The calendar keeps that full-width measure, but the three headline readings no longer add a
 * second visual block beneath it. They are one compact sentence beside the ramp key now. The grid
 * remains the section's mark; its supporting counts should not make ACTIVITY feel like two stacked
 * sections.
 *
 * ## Why the ramp is fixed, not normalized
 *
 * The old year grid normalized against the busiest day, so the same 1-session Tuesday changed shade
 * depending on whether you once did three-a-days in March. Training counts run 0–3; there are only
 * ever three rungs of meaning, so they are spent directly: trained, trained twice, trained more.
 * A fixed ramp means a lit square means the same thing in January and in August, and it is what the
 * key can honestly label.
 *
 * Days outside the month draw nothing, so the grid keeps the month's own ragged first and last
 * rows. Days still ahead of today draw below the rest-day rung — the month keeps its full shape
 * without claiming a future day is a rest day.
 *
 * Swapping back to the year is one call site in [ProfileScreen]; both live in the package.
 */

/**
 * The gap between day cells. The cell itself is not a fixed size: seven columns have to fit the
 * page's measure exactly, so each takes an equal share of what is left and the cell squares itself
 * off that. Widening the gap therefore costs cell size rather than section height — the two trade
 * against each other and the grid's height stays ~6/7 of the measure either way.
