/**
 * One performed set within a logged exercise.
 *
 * Both `weightText` and `weightLb` are stored:
 *  - `weightText` is what the user typed verbatim ("BW", "2 plates", "45")
 *    and is what's shown back in the UI.
 *  - `weightLb` is the parsed numeric value used by aggregates (volume,
 *    PR detection, strength curves). `null` when the input is non-numeric
 *    (e.g. "BW") — aggregates should treat that as 0 lb or skip it.
