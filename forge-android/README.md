# Forge — Android (native)

Native Kotlin/Compose rewrite of the React/Expo prototype that lives in `../forge/`.
The prototype is the **feature spec**, not the build target — see [`../forge/src/WorkoutTracker.web.jsx`](../forge/src/WorkoutTracker.web.jsx).

## Status — Phase 2 complete

Phases 0–2 are done. The skeleton builds and installs, the static program data is in code, and the Room layer (8 entities, 8 DAOs, 4 repositories, all Hilt-wired) is in place. UI is still all placeholders — set logging lands in Phase 3.

What is wired up:

- Gradle (Kotlin DSL) + version catalog at [`gradle/libs.versions.toml`](gradle/libs.versions.toml)
- Compose (Material 3 dark theme), Activity, single-Activity nav
- Hilt DI (Application + Activity entry points, ClockModule, DatabaseModule)
- Room schema v2 with 8 entities — Session, LoggedExercise, LoggedSet, ExerciseCustomization, DayNameOverride, UnlockedTrophy, CardioEntry, MoodEntry. `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` until first real workout is logged.
- 4 repositories — WorkoutRepository, CustomizationRepository, CardioRepository, TrophyRepository
- Static program in [`program/`](app/src/main/java/com/forge/app/program/) — Program (4 days, 25 exercises), Swaps (50 variants across 11 muscle groups), Trophies (21), Tutorials (per-exercise text)
- DataStore Preferences dependency (not yet used — wires in Phase 3)
- Coroutines + Lifecycle Compose integration
- 5 placeholder screens routed through `ForgeNavHost`

## First-time setup

1. Open `forge-android/` in Android Studio (Iguana or newer).
2. Let it run "Sync Project with Gradle Files" — first sync downloads ~1 GB of dependencies and creates the Gradle wrapper jar (~10 min).
3. Build & Run on an emulator or your phone (USB-debug + Run).

The Compose-side `ForgeTheme` governs the in-app look. The XML `Theme.Forge` only exists to set the window background so there's no white flash on cold launch.

## Phase plan

| # | Phase | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **0** ✅ | Scaffold | App builds, installs, navigates between placeholder screens |
| **1** ✅ | Static program data | `program/` package with PROGRAM, SWAPS, TROPHIES, tutorials |
| **2** ✅ | Room schema + DAOs + repositories | DB persists sessions, sets, customizations, cardio, moods, trophies |
| **3** ◀ next | **Gym training feature** | Log a real workout end-to-end on the phone |
| 4 | Overview screen | Real weekly stats |
| 5 | Stats subtab | Heatmap, strength curves, weekly volume, PR timeline |
| 6 | Trophies | Catalog + unlock evaluator + animation |
| 7 | Cardio | Manual entry, recent list, weekly stats |
| 8 | Polish | Haptics on PR, background notification for rest timer, export, mood prompt |
| 9 | Nutrition | Planned separately when we get there |

## Conventions

- One Compose screen per file. Screens >~300 lines → split sub-components into a sibling `components/` package.
- One ViewModel per screen. ViewModels >~150 lines → extract use-case logic into `domain/`.
- One Room entity per file in `data/db/entities/`; one DAO per file in `data/db/dao/`.
- KSP, not KAPT (faster builds, Kotlin-native).
- Modules: `:app` (phone) + `:wear` (watch app, W1) + `:shared` (pure Kotlin — the wear protocol,
  rest-timer core and weight-step table both apps compile) + `:baselineprofile`. Everything else
  stays in `:app`; `:shared` holds ONLY what both apps need (no Room, no Hilt, no UI).
- No chart library (custom Compose `Canvas`).
- No analytics, no crash reporting, no cloud sync.
